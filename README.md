# Android SQLite Multiple (Three) Tables CRUD Tutorial

We'll design this type of sample Android App using `SQLite` database to store data. Here I've created three tables `student`, `subject` and `student_subject`. Here `student_subject` is a pivot table. This table will store data which student is taken which subjects.

You will find all of database related code in [this package](https://github.com/hasancse91/Android-SQLite-Tutorial/tree/master/03.SQLite-Multiple-(Three)-Tables-CRUD/app/src/main/java/com/hellohasan/sqlite_multiple_three_tables_crud/database).
Thare are some interfaces and their implementations. I tried to separate database related code from Activity.
